</p>
<br>
Mini Project in C Contact Management System is a simple console application without graphics. It is similar to the contact manager in cell phones. In this  project, you can add, view, edit, search and delete contacts. All added and edited records are saved in a file.

You can list contacts by name, phone no., address and email. File handling has been used to record all data. I have used data structure to store the user name, email and contact. Overall, understanding the simple source code of this project will teach you how to add, edit, search, list and remove data using file.

<!-- How to Manage -->
## How To Manage
1.Select one of the option or number you want to access.<br><br>
2.After selecting the format you want to save click on the save button and move forward. Now when data is saved it will ask again to show information inside the system, now it depends upon the user what he or she wants to access. <br><br>
3.Whenever a option is selected the contact is saved inside the system. (images available below)<br>
